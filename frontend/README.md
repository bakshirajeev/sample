# PowerBI Catalog UI

A simple React application that fetches the catalog from the backend API and displays it.

## Install and Run

Requires Node.js. Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app expects the backend API to be running on the same host at `/api/catalog`.
